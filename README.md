# Task Title: Positive

# Task Description: 
Write a Java program named Positive.java that reads a double value from the user.

Take the following actions, depending on the value:
• If the value is positive, request a second value. Print the difference between
these two numbers so that the difference is always positive. For instance, if the
first value is 10.3 and the second is 4.1, you would print the result of 6.2. If the
first value is 3.8 and the second is 13.4 you would print the result 9.6.

• If the first value read is negative, print its positive equivalent. For instance, if its
value is –89.6 you should print 89.6.

• If the first value is not a number, give appropriate error message (The standard
error message from Java (e.g. “Exception in thread "main” ...”) does not count!
Have a look at the Java API or Stack Overflow how to approach this).
